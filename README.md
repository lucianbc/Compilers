# Compilation Theory Homework

Homework for the *Compilation Theory Course* at the University of Bucharest. There are two projects, both parsing a subset of the C programming language:
* **KtLexer**: a lexer implemented from scratch using the **Kotlin** programming language.
* **LexicalAnalysis**: a lexer implemented in **C++** by using the **lex** library.
